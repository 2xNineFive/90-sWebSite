            I am an apprentice electrician and web development student. 
            I work at IES Residential Electric and study web development at Digital Crafts.
            My goal is to transition into a career as a junior web developer before I graduate.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            My ideal position is:
            <li>Remote</li>
            <li>Pays a competitive entry level salary</li>
            <li>Offers competitive benefits</li>
            <li>And offers <strong>upward mobility</strong></li>
            <em>I am interested in the music industry.</em>
        </p> -->
        <p>
            During my first three weeks at Digital Crafts I learned:
            <li>to set up my coding environment</li>
            <li>to use my terminal to interact with my computer</li>
            <li>to use Git and GitHub for managing my repos</li>
            <li>to apply Javascript fundamentals such as: functions, arrays, and looping</li>
            <li>to create directories for HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
            <li>to create HTML documents with basic formatting</li>
            <li>to create CSS documents and link them to HTML</li>
            <li>to apply CSS properties to HTML elements</li>
            <em>I created this webpage during week three of my program.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            My main hobby at the moment is learning web development. I daily read Mark Myers, "A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript," and complete the exercises
            at the end of every chapter. I find web development to be a challenge I enjoy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My main hobby aside from web development is music. I love making bass house, hard trap, and drum and bass. I started making music in 2014 when I was interested
            in becoming a rapper. The beats were too expensive for me to buy so I decided to make my own. I watched Youtube tutorials to learn how to make trap beats. 
            I discovered EDM in college when my roommate brought out his DJ controller and started mixing music. I fell in love with the bass music. 
        </p>

            I own a small home studio. It consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>My Macbook Pro</li>
                <li>Ableton Live 11</li>
                <li>A Focsrite 2i2 Audio Interface</li>
                <li>2 Yamaha HS8 monitors</li>
                <li>2 Hardware Synths</li>
                <li>A really expensive mic I never use</li>
                <li>hundreds of samples and plugins!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I eventually want to attend Icon Collective to further develop my music making abilities.</p>
